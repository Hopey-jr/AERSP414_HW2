Within Question 03, the issues that could be experienced during the development of the program involve the aspect of logic, synchronization, and timing constraints. The code has to be developed in a logical manner that does not allow multiple aircraft to be communicating with the ATC personnel at the same time. In addition, the code has to simulate a queue in order to develop the understanding that every incoming aircraft cannot be accepted to a traffic pattern since that can cause an overload of aircraft attempting to land on the runway. The issues with the problem being described in Question 03 involve the race condition where the ATC is sleeping while the aircraft wait to establish communication in order to get into the traffic pattern or land, which arises due to the amount of time that is taken by certain actions. The race conditions can lead to incorrect behavior being experienced by the code, such as multiple aircraft being allowed into the traffic pattern simultaneously or the ATC being awoken at the wrong time. Thread synchronization is another issue that could arise causing the traffic pattern to be inconsistency managed or other behaviors of the simulation to not be executed properly. 
The problem described within Question 03 has real world applications since it represents a scenario that involves the amount of time that certain actions can take, such as waking up the ATC and checking the traffic pattern. However, there are issues that can occur when certain actions take time to finish. Communicating with the ATC takes time because in a realistic process, there is a delay when waking up the ATC from a sleeping state after it has completed communication with another pilot. In addition, pilots have to ensure that there is no other aircraft with established communication to the ATC before initializing the waking up process. The landing process can be delayed when an aircraft is checking the traffic pattern since it takes time to complete that action. Finally, diverting to another airport introduces delays for aircraft since they have to begin the same process of establishing communication with the ATC or entering the traffic pattern in a different location. 
A solution for the race condition is using the mutex library to ensure that the actions being taken are mutually exclusive. The mutex solution would ensure that only one aircraft establishes communication with the ATC at a time. In addition, locking a mutex will prevent race conditions when an aircraft is causing an update to the traffic pattern. A solution for the thread synchronization issue is the use of the condition variable, which synchronizes the simulation of an aircraft attempting to land with the process of waking up the ATC. The condition variable causes the aircraft to wait for the ATC to be available in order to ensure a proper sequence of events to occur. A potential solution for the time issue is to use the chrono library to simulate the time that it takes for actions to occur by including std::this_thread::sleep_for() within the code to reflect any delays.
